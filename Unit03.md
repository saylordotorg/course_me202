**Unit 3: Two-Dimensional Kinematics of a Rigid Body** <span
id="3"></span> 
*In the first two units, we studied objects as single points, without
any particular orientation.  We will now abandon this simplified view
and study full objects.  As with particle dynamics, we will begin with a
look at the kinematics of rigid bodies, but will not consider 1-D motion
since these objects (and the points on them) exist in at least 2-D (in a
plane). We will also formulate and solve problems to understand the
practical implications of theory learned. *
