**Unit 1: Kinematics of Particles** <span id="1"></span> 

*<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: normal; ">*In this
first unit, we will look at the motion of particles.  We are
specifically concerned with the position, velocity, and acceleration of
objects.  To keep things from getting cloudy, as we consider each object
(whether a car, a space shuttle, or a molecule), we will only pay
attention to where that object is, not how it is orientated or where it
is pointing.*</span>           *

*Initially, we will consider one-dimensional motion alone.  Consider an
everyday example: as you drive along the highway, you have the option of
going in only one direction.  You can come back by the same highway, but
you are still on one single straight-line path.* *We will also formulate
and solve problems to understand the practical implications of theory
learned.*
**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 20.5 hours to complete.
