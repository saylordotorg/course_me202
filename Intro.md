Course Syllabus for "ME202: Mechanics II - Dynamics"
----------------------------------------------------

Dynamics is a sub-branch of the general field of study known as
Mechanics.  It is very closely related to—and often combined with—the
study of Statics, which you encountered in [ME102: Mechanics
I](http://www.saylor.org/courses/me102/). In both Statics and Dynamics,
we use Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law: F = ma.  In Statics, the sum of the
applied forces is always zero, thus making the acceleration zero.  This
was very important to the structures studied in Statics.  Catastrophe
generally results when structures (like bridges and buildings)
accelerate.  Very likely you are quite pleased—even if you do not
realize it every time—when you cross a bridge that does not accelerate
while you are on it, and we have Newton’s First Law to thank for it. 
Newton’s First Law states that objects will continue to do what they are
doing unless unbalanced forces make them do otherwise.  This law
includes the law equilibrium condition that the moments will also sum to
zero, and that there will thus be no rotational acceleration.  In
Dynamics, the sum of the forces will not necessarily be zero (if it is
zero, then the sum of the moments is not).  We will thus study
accelerated motion. As with [PHYS101: Introduction to
Mechanics](http://www.saylor.org/courses/phys101/), we will begin this
course by studying the accelerated motion of particles (also known as
the Kinematics of Particles).  We will only look at what an object is
doing (the position, velocity, acceleration)—not why it might be doing
that. In Unit 2, we will take a look at the Kinetics of Particles, or
the study of the *why* of Kinematics.  We will want to know how to
change the velocity of a particle in order to learn what causes
accelerations. We will then take a step towards the more realistic by
considering the size, shape, and orientation of objects as they
accelerate.  We term this type of motion “Rigid Body Motion.”  We begin,
in Unit 3, with the Kinematics of Rigid Bodies, looking first at the
rotational motion of objects.  We will then introduce the possibility
that objects can move (and accelerate) translationally *and*
rotationally at the same time.  In Unit 4, we will look at sample
problems that will help you understand the concepts learned in Unit 1,
Unit 2, and Unit 3. Next, in Unit 5, we study the Kinematics of such
motion. In Unit 6, we will look at many of the principles we learned in
the first few units-this time, in three-dimensions.  We will begin with
the three-dimensional Kinematics of a Rigid Body and then finish with
three-dimensional Kinetics. We will complete our study of Dynamics with
Unit 7, a look at Vibrational Motion, or what happens when objects
oscillate about a neutral state. In Unit 4, we will look at sample
problems that will help you understand the concepts learned in Unit 5,
Unit 6, and Unit 7.
