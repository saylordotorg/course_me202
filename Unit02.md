**Unit 2: Kinetics of a Particle** <span id="2"></span> 
*So far, we have only been concerned with what a particle is doing, i.e.
what is the particle’s position?  What is its velocity? What is its
acceleration?  We have not yet asked “How do particles get that
acceleration?  How do we make particles accelerate in certain ways?”*  
 *             
 In this unit, we will use three methods to answer those questions (and
others).  These three methods are really three ways of looking at
Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law  [ ∑F = ma ] but each will allow us to solve
certain types of problems in very efficient ways.  One of the methods
can in fact save your life. We will also formulate and solve problems to
understand the practical implications of theory learned.*

     Newton’s Second Law is the first of three methods we will use to
    solve the very reasonable question: “How do we get a particle to
    accelerate in a particular way?”  This method works for very general
    problems.
