**Unit 4: Two-Dimensional Kinetics of a Rigid Body** <span
id="4"></span> 
*We will now look at how we cause the 2-D rigid body accelerations
studied in Unit 3.  As with particles, there are three approaches to
these problems: analyzing force and acceleration, analyzing work and
energy, and analyzing impulse and momentum. We will also formulate and
solve problems to understand the practical implications of theory
learned.*
