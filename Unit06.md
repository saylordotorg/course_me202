**Unit 6: Vibrations** <span id="6"></span> 
*Objects subject to a restoring force will vibrate about a neutral
position.  In this unit, we will look at the four basic modes of
vibration and then derive ways in which we can model them. We will also
formulate and solve problems to understand the practical implications of
theory learned.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 4 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.1: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.2: 2 hours

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

     Instructions: The problems in this subunit will help you apply
    principles learned in free vibration of rigid bodies under the
    application of frictional or non-frictional forces (viscous and
    non-viscous frictional forces).  Scroll down about 2/3 of the
    webpage until you reach Example 1.  Please read through “Example 1,”
    “Example 2,” and “Example 3.”

    bottom of the webpage until you reach the heading “5.4.7 Example
    Problems in Forced Vibrations,” and read “Example 1,” “Example 2,”
    and “Example 3.”
