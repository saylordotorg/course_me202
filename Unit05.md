**Unit 5: Three-Dimensional Dynamics** <span id="5"></span> 
*So far we have dealt equations of motion and mechanics in two
dimensions.  Two dimensional analyses are essential to understanding how
particles and rigid bodies behave when acted upon by forces and moments.
 As most of the objects are three dimensional, projecting the theories
learned in two dimensional mechanics to three dimensional is important
to capture realistic and real world scenarios.  We will now take all
that we have learned so far and extend it into full three-dimensions.We
will also formulate and solve problems to understand the practical
implications of theory learned.*
